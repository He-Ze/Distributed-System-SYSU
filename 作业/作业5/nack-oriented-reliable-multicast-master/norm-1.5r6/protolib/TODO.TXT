Protolib is a work in progress.  Its features reflect the current (and past) 
needs of our research group.  This list is a list of things we might add in 
the future:

0) Documentation, documentation, documentation!!!  Code documentation and
   "Developers' Guide" materials.
   
1) ProtoDisptacher use of "epoll()" (Linux), "kqueue()" (BSD), and "/dev/poll"
   (Solaris) for enhanced performance over the current use of "select()".  We 
   may also explore use of "pselect()" further if it makes sense.

2) Generalize the Mutex stuff used in ProtoDispatcher for general purpose
   thread synchronization purposes ...

3) Make code truly UNICODE compliant ... In particular, any functions which 
   take/return strings (currently "char*") should instead use "tchar" 
   types/functions as appropriate.
