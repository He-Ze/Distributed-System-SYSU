To build vifExample download the openVpn and winPcap code.  You will need both the source and binary wpcap distributions.

Update the project include path to point to the location of these projects.

Note that there is currently an issue with winpcap and visual studio 2008 - a temporary solution is 
advised below:


1. rename ntddnis.h file in

C:\cygwin\home\nrl\WpdPack\Include

2.

Hi,

Regarding irritating change to the MS compiler above...

FWIW I believe that the correct approach for a formal change to cope 
with this would be along the following lines (once the winpcap project 
starts using/supporting MS VS C++ 2008 - though the change can be made 
at any time)

pcap-stdinc.h:
=======================
#if _MSC_VER < 1500
#define vsnprintf _vsnprintf
#endif
=======================
compiler version 1500 comes with "MS VS C++ 2008"
other versions against release (non-exhaustive)
  2005 is  1400
  2003 is  1310
  2002 is  1300
  6.0  is  1200
  4.2  is  1020

(This file is only included in a WIN32 windows build (see pcap.h) so 
_MSC_VER should be defined in that case, however one could add 
'defined(_MSC_VER) &&' for belt-and-braces protection)

I'll add this note to the issue-ticket that I raised on the libpcap 
project. Though clearly fixing/changing it is clearly (to me) within the 
remit of winpcap project.

cheers,
    James.
