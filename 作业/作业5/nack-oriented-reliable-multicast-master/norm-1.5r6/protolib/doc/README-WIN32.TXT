This directory contains the VC++ project files for
building the PROTOLIB and example "protoApp" 
command-line project.

The VC++ project contains a couple of options to build
a Win32 "console" (subsystem:console) or a Win32 "gui"
(subsystem:windows) application with a command-line
interface.  The "gui" version can be easily modified 
to have no user interface for background processing or as 
an example to use the PROTOLIB classes in classical GUI Win32 
applications.
