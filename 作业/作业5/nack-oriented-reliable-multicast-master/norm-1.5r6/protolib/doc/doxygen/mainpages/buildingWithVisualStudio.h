Visual Studio solution files for building protolib are included in
the distribution in the protolib/makefiles/win32 directory. 

Load the appropriate solution file into Visual Studio (project files for Visual
Studio 2008 Express and Pro Editions are provided) and configure VS to build 
either a Debug or Release version of the library.  The library will be placed in
the protolib/makefiles/win32/Release or protolib/makefiles/Debug as appropriate.
