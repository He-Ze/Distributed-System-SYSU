This directory contains a simple example of a Unix
command-line application "protoApp" using the PROTOLIB
ProtocolTimer and UdpSocket classes.

TO BUILD:

type "make protoApp"

(Note: The "Makefile" has been tested for Linux using
 gcc 2.96. It can be easily modified for other
 platforms or compilers.)
