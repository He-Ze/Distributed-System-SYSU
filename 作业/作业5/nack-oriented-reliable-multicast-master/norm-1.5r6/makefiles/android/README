This directory contains an Android NDK import module for NORM, which builds
a shared library, and the JNI bindings.

Using NORM in your pure Java Android Application
------------------------------------------------

1. First, update the library project to point to your Android SDK:

    android update lib-project --target <id> --path /path/to/norm/makefiles/android
    android update lib-project --target <id> --path /path/to/protolib/makefiles/android

   Use "android list targets" to see the ids of the SDK targets you have
   installed.

2. Add a "jni/Application.mk" in the root of your project to reference NORM:
    * You must at least set "APP_MODULES := norm-jni"
    * You should set "APP_BUILD_SCRIPT := /path/to/norm/makefiles/android/jni/Android.mk"
    * You should also set "NDK_MODULE_PATH" to point to the base norm directory
      so that the NDK can find protolib.  See the example.

   Example:

    LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)

    APP_MODULES := mil_navy_nrl_norm
    APP_ABI := all
    APP_BUILD_SCRIPT := $(LOCAL_PATH)/../library/norm/makefiles/android/jni/Android.mk

    NDK_MODULE_PATH := $(LOCAL_PATH)../library/norm/

3. Reference the NORM Android library project in your "project.properties"
   file.  Add the following:

    android.library.reference.1=/path/to/norm/makefiles/android

Now, you should be able to run "ndk-build" in your root project directory to
build the shared libraries, and run "ant debug" to build your APK.

Using NORM in your C/C++/Java Android Application
-------------------------------------------------

1. Add a "jni/Application.mk" with your C/C++ code specified.

2. Reference the NORM Android project as an NDK Import Module.  See
   "IMPORT-MODULE.html" in the NDK docs.

   Put something like the following at the bottom of your "Android.mk"

    $(call import-module,norm/makefiles/android/jni)

   This is relative to the "NDK_MODULE_PATH" variable that must be defined in
   "Application.mk".
